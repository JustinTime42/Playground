# WebDevClass
Code and notes for web developer 2018 class
The website for this repo is hosted here: https://slarti-42.github.io/WebDevClass/

This is just a repository of study notes for this web development class on udemy along with other cool web/computer stuff we're working on. Feel free to contribue more links: to your own work, or other helpful resources.

We are all still using GitHub, and this is a very casual repository, so don't be afraid to upload whatever you want, where ever you want. As we learn how to use this better we can always reorganize. 

Feel free to upload your own websites or other projects your working on in the code sction, questions, suggestions, etc in the issues section, and notes and other stuff in the wiki section.
